# Willie's VRC Programs
These are programs built for the VEX Robotics Competition Turning Point for
the 2018 season.

Most of the documentation can be found on the [project website](https://thecraftkid.github.io/vex-robot-2018).

## Developing
Run `git clone https://github.com/TheCraftKid/vex-robot-2018.git`.

Run the initialization script before you do anything else.

For Windows systems, open PowerShell at the project's root directory, and then
run the script:
```powershell
.\init.ps1
```

An easy shortcut for opening PowerShell is to open this project in Windows
Explorer, pressing Alt + D, typing in "powershell", and pressing Enter.

For Unix-based systems, open bash (or equivalent), and run the script:
```bash 
./init.sh
```

Consult the [docs](./docs/workflow.md) to learn about the rest of the
development workflow for Foxbot.
