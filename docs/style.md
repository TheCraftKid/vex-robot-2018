# Foxbot Repository Style Guide

For the most part, just follow the Google C++ Style Guide.

For the other part, as much as I prefer the [1TBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#1TBS),
this project uses the [Allman style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style)
as it's how ROBOTC formats files by default.
